##  Insights
1. Relatively higher number of posts appear on the weekends.
This shows that Pinterest users are most active on weekends, suggesting these are ideal days for product promotions to reach more people.

3. Posts peak around midnight and evening. There are less posts in the morning around 7-8 am.
This gives a hint that users browse or post during late night and before bed. Brands should target these hours for higher visibility.

5. Highest likes go to the categories like "Food and drink","Inspirational quotes","Fashion","Home decor".
This means that in order to maximize likes one should focus on visually engaging categories such as food, quotes, and fashion-related promotions.
